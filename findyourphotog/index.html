      SMAC! (Sock Monkeys Against Cancer) is a non-profit oraganization that allows people to gift special sockmonkeys to those battling cancer, to remind them that they are not alone in their fight.  Working with a team of 6, I helped design and build a new site that would help match cancer patients to angels that are willing to cover the cost of donating a SMAC! monkey.
