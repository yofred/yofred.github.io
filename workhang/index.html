      Workhang is a site for students, mentors and anyone who works remotely to be able to connect with others who are in a similar situation.  Like 4square, users on the site can check in to a location and view others that are checked in nearby. Users can then message each other using twilio, and arrange to meet up. I was responsible for handing the back-end for this project in a team of three.
