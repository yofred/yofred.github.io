    <p>
SMAC! (Sock Monkeys Against Cancer) is a non-profit oraganization that allows people to gift special sockmonkeys to those battling cancer, to remind them that they are not alone in their fight. Working with a team of 6, I helped design and build the front-end of this site.  The site will be live soon.

    <i>Back-end development for location check-in site.</i>    
    <p>
Workhang is a site for students, mentors and anyone who works remotely to be able to connect with others who are in a similar situation. Like 4square, users of the site can check in to a location and view others that are checked in nearby. Users can then message each other using twilio, and arrange to meet up. I was responsible for handing the back-end for this project in a team of three.

    <i>UX design for a social-DJ’ing site</i>    
    <p>
Dubtrack.FM is a social DJ site where users can share music to a community of music-lovers who can vote on whether or not they enjoy the tune. It’s a Turntable.fm clone but without the silly dancing characters and uses youtube and soundcloud to get rid of any annoying licensing issues. I helped start this site with two friends. I contributed to the UI of the site while the two other project members helped build it.
