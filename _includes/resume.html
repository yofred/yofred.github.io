    <i>Back-end development for a location check-in site.</i>
    <p>
Workhang is a site for students, mentors and anyone who works remotely to be able to connect with others who are in a similar situation. Like 4square, users of the site can check in to a location and view others that are checked in nearby. Users can then message each other using twilio, and arrange to meet up. I was responsible for handing the back-end for this project in a team of three.<p>

    <b>Dubtrack</b><br>
    <i>UX design for a social-DJ’ing site</i>
    <p>
Dubtrack.FM is a social DJ site where users can share music to a community of music-lovers who can vote on whether or not they enjoy the tune. It’s a Turntable.fm clone but without the silly dancing characters and uses youtube and soundcloud to get rid of any annoying licensing issues. I helped start this site with two friends. I contributed to the UI of the site while the two other project members helped build it.

    <b>Google Maps Envelope Concept</b><br>
    <i>Design concept for a Google product</i>
    <p>
This is a concept I developed with a friend that made some rounds on some tech-blogs. The idea is that a mail's route are printed directly onto the envelope using Google Maps API. The project was picked up by a company based in Lincoln, Nebraska but is currently in hiatus.
