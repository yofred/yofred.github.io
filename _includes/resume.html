    <b>Google Maps Envelope Concept</b><br>
    <br />
    <i>Design concept for a Google product</i>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
This is a concept I developed with a friend that had a good amount of exposure on tech blogs. The idea is that a letter's shipping routes were printed onto the envelope using Google Maps API. The project was picked up by a company based in Lincoln, Nebraska but is currently in hiatus.
