Dubtrack.FM is a social DJ site where users can share music to a community of music-lovers who can vote on whether or not they enjoy the tune.  It's a Turntable.fm clone but without the silly dancing characters and uses youtube and soundcloud to get rid of any annoying licensing issues.  I helped start this site with two friends.  I contributed to the UI of the site while the two other project members helped build it.
